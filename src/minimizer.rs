/// This function tests for the convergence of the interval [x_lower, x_upper] with absolute error epsabs and relative error epsrel. The
/// test returns ::Value::Success if the following condition is achieved,
///
/// ```text
/// |a - b| < epsabs + epsrel min(|a|,|b|)
/// ```
///
/// when the interval `x = [a,b]` does not include the origin. If the interval includes the origin then `\min(|a|,|b|)` is replaced by zero (
/// which is the minimum value of `|x|` over the interval). This ensures that the relative error is accurately estimated for minima close to
/// the origin.
///
/// This condition on the interval also implies that any estimate of the minimum x_m in the interval satisfies the same condition with
/// respect to the true minimum x_m^*,
///
/// ```text
/// |x_m - x_m^*| < epsabs + epsrel x_m^*
/// ```
///
/// assuming that the true minimum x_m^* is contained within the interval.
